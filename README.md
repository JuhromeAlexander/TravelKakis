## To install the application for testing (Android devices)

Download the APK based on your device's architecture [here](https://github.com/JuhromeAlexander/TravelKakis/tree/feature/no-ref/authentication/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk). If you are unsure, you can just download the general APK file (app-release.apk).

Afterwards, you can send the APK into your phone and install it.
